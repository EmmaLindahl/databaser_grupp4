We founded this site to inform the public of the similarity betwen different plants that belong to
the same plant family. The reason why is because their apperances looks similar, and that might
propose a problem since some of the family members are very poisonous. That is why we want to make
the public aware of the importance to tell the difference before touching or eating a plant. </pre>
